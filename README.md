# Distance Vector Simulation
## About
This program simulates distance vector routing using the Bellman-Ford <br>
algorithm to showcase how routers exchange their distance vector tables. <br>
Each node represents a router and each link represents a network connection.
## Usages
- Use `python dvs_gui` to run the program.
> [!NOTE]
